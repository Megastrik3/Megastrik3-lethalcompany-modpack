Welcome to the repository for our Lethal Company modpack! This repository tracks the mod profiles we use to play together.

## 📂 Modpack Variants

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before installing the modpack, you need the mod manager software.

### 1. Install r2modman
We use **r2modman** to manage all mods. It is a safe, open-source manager that handles dependencies automatically.

* [**Download r2modman here**](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases)
    * *Note: Select the `r2modman-Setup-x.x.x.exe` asset from the latest release.*

### 2. Download the Modpack File
Click the button below to go to the Releases page where the files are located:
